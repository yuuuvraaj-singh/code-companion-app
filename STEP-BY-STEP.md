# ðŸ“‹ Code Companion - Complete Step-by-Step Setup

## ðŸŽ¯ Choose Your Installation Method

### Method 1: Instant Demo (No Setup Required) âš¡
1. Find the file `standalone.html` in your project folder
2. Double-click it to open in your browser
3. Start using Code Companion immediately!

### Method 2: Full Installation (Recommended) ðŸ”§

#### Step 1: Install Node.js
**On macOS:**
```bash
# If you have Homebrew:
brew install node

# If you don't have Homebrew, install it first:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**On Windows:**
1. Go to https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the LTS version
3. Run the installer
4. Restart your computer

**On Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

#### Step 2: Verify Installation
Open terminal/command prompt and run:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```
You should see version numbers (like v18.17.0)

#### Step 3: Navigate to Project
**You're already in the right directory!** 

Since you can see all the Code Companion files (package.json, src/, public/, etc.), you can skip this step.

If you need to navigate here from elsewhere:
```bash
# Only if you're in a different directory
cd /path/to/where/you/saved/code-companion
```

#### Step 4: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
Wait for it to complete (may take 1-2 minutes)

#### Step 5: Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```
You should see: "Code Companion server running on http://localhost:3000"

#### Step 6: Open Your Browser
Go to: `http://localhost:3000`

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "npm: command not found"
**Solution:** Node.js isn't installed properly
- Restart your terminal
- Try the Node.js installation steps again

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'express'"
**Solution:** Dependencies not installed
```bash
npm install
```

### Issue: "localhost refused to connect"
**Solution:** Server isn't running
- Make sure you see "server running" message
- Check you're using the correct URL: http://localhost:3000

### Issue: "Port 3000 is already in use"
**Solution:** Another app is using port 3000
```bash
# Kill the process using port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill

# Or change the port in src/index.js to 3001
```
